Installation

Funannotate has a lot of dependencies and therefore installation is the most difficult part
of executing the pipeline. I've tried hard to make installation as painless as possible, but
in the land of dependencies (POSIX) this is pretty much impossible.  I've arranged the different
installation methods here from easiest to most difficult.

1. * :ref:`docker`.  Likely the easiest solution, but not the best in my opinion. Use this to give funannotate a test drive, but to use the entire functionality you will likely need to install locally.


2. * :ref:`conda`. Mostly automated installation using Minconda2.


3. * :ref:`homebrew`. Mostly automated installation on Linux or Mac. No longer supported, use Conda.


4. * :ref:`manual`. Simply install the GitHub repository and manually install rest of tools. You'll likely have to take this route on an HPC for example. In this case, many of the bioinformatics dependencies are perhaps already installed.


5. * :ref:`dependencies`.  There are lots of dependencies, have a look at what you will need here.
